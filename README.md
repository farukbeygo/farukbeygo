# Hello, I'm Ã–mer Faruk Beygo!

I'm a mathematics student at Bilkent University, and I'm interested in coding with C#, Java, and Python. I'm also fascinated by the field of deep learning and its potential applications.

## About Me

- ðŸŽ“ I'm currently pursuing a degree in Mathematics at Bilkent University.
- ðŸ’» I'm proficient in C#, Java, and Python, and I'm always eager to learn more.
- ðŸ¤– I'm interested in the field of deep learning and its potential applications in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.
- ðŸ“š In my free time, I enjoy reading books on mathematics, computer science, and technology.

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Delivery Car Game](https://github.com/[your-username]/DeliveryCarGame): a 3D game built with Unity and C# where the player controls a delivery car and must navigate through city streets to deliver packages to customers.
- [Snake Game](https://github.com/[your-username]/SnakeGame): a classic snake game built with Python and the Turtle module.
- [Project Euler Solutions](https://github.com/[your-username]/ProjectEulerSolutions): my solutions to problems from Project Euler, a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems.
